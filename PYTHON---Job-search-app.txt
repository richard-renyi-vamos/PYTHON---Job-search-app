Creating a Python script to search for jobs on multiple job portals requires a structured approach. Since scraping websites is subject to terms of service and legal considerations, it's better to use publicly available APIs if the portals provide them. Below is a sample Python script that uses APIs (if available) and web scraping with BeautifulSoup for portals without APIs.

This script is designed for portals like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, or Indeed, depending on access and permissions. Replace placeholders with actual API keys or credentials.

python
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Job portals to search
job_portals = {
    "LinkedIn": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/",
    "Glassdoor": "https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm",
    "Indeed": "https://www.indeed.com/jobs",
}

def search_linkedin(job_title, location):
    """
    Searches LinkedIn for jobs.
    This example uses a placeholder as LinkedIn scraping often requires advanced methods or paid APIs.
    """
    print("Searching LinkedIn...")
    params = {"keywords": job_title, "location": location}
    response = requests.get(job_portals["LinkedIn"], params=params)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
        jobs = soup.find_all("div", class_="base-card__full-link")  # Adjust class as per LinkedIn's current structure
        for job in jobs[:5]:  # Print first 5 jobs
            print(job.text.strip())
    else:
        print("LinkedIn search failed. Status code:", response.status_code)


def search_glassdoor(job_title, location):
    """
    Searches Glassdoor for jobs.
    """
    print("Searching Glassdoor...")
    params = {"sc.keyword": job_title, "locT": "C", "locId": location}  # Adjust params as per Glassdoor's query structure
    response = requests.get(job_portals["Glassdoor"], params=params)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
        jobs = soup.find_all("li", class_="jl")  # Adjust as per Glassdoor's structure
        for job in jobs[:5]:
            title = job.find("a", class_="jobLink").text.strip()
            print(f"Job Title: {title}")
    else:
        print("Glassdoor search failed. Status code:", response.status_code)


def search_indeed(job_title, location):
    """
    Searches Indeed for jobs.
    """
    print("Searching Indeed...")
    params = {"q": job_title, "l": location}
    response = requests.get(job_portals["Indeed"], params=params)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
        jobs = soup.find_all("div", class_="job_seen_beacon")  # Adjust as per Indeed's structure
        for job in jobs[:5]:
            title = job.find("h2", class_="jobTitle").text.strip()
            print(f"Job Title: {title}")
    else:
        print("Indeed search failed. Status code:", response.status_code)


def main():
    job_title = input("Enter the job title: ")
    location = input("Enter the location: ")

    # Search jobs on different portals
    search_linkedin(job_title, location)
    search_glassdoor(job_title, location)
    search_indeed(job_title, location)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Key Points:
APIs vs. Scraping:

Use APIs if available (e.g., LinkedIn API requires OAuth and membership).
For portals without APIs, carefully scrape public job listings, adhering to their terms of service.
Libraries:

Requests: For HTTP requests.
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML.
JSON (not shown but useful for APIs): For API responses.
Headers/User Agent:

Add headers to mimic browser requests to avoid being blocked:
python
Copy code
headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
Legal Considerations:

Scraping should comply with each site's terms of use.
Use APIs or official developer tools whenever possible.
Future Enhancements:

Add support for more portals.
Save results to a file (CSV/JSON).
Create a GUI or integrate with a database.
